# Agent Instructions

Before running the project, you need to set the required environment variables. These are defined in `global_config/global_config.py`.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
DEV_ENV=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

Fill in the values for each variable.
